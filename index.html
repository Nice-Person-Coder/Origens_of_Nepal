        <h4 class="container"> Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred to variously as Ne Muni or
            Nemi.
            According to Pashupati Purana, as a place protected by Ne, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to
            be known as Nepal. The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian
            subcontinent, the era in
            ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first
            millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of
            northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is
            intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as
            Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The
            cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha
            Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later
            formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never
            colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was
            introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in
            the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's
            last Hindu monarchy.
            The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic
            divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were
            signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian
            Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of
            the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest
            in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a
            significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.</h4>
